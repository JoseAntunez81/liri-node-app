# liri-node-app
 LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
 I used Javascript and Node to develop this aplication
 Liri will give you information about any specific movie that you want and also you can name any artists you want and get info.
